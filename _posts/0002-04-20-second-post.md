**Week 3 Reflection**

Contrary to the common understanding and applications of usable security, this week’s readings covered the study of ethnography and the relation between it and technologies. Now if you’ve never heard of ethnography you wouldn’t be alone. I had to search this topic up before diving too far into the readings to have a basic concept of what I was trying to understand for the week. Ethnography is described as the “the scientific description of the customs of individual peoples and cultures.”

In our first reading Ethnography of Infrastructure by Susan Star, she went into detail about her time as an ethnographer. Discussing how things we see as basic and common placed infrastructure can really have cultural effects tied along with them. Trying to find the master narrative behind why things are the way that they are. She described infrastructure as:

•	Become part of human organization 
•	Has different properties to it 
•	Embeddedness 
•	Transparency reach or scope 
•	Learned as part of membership 
•	Links with conventions of practice 
•	Embodiment of standards 
•	Built on an installed base 
•	Becomes visible upon breakdown 
•	Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally

This helps to serve as a baseline as to what good infrastructure should provide. It should be seamless to the user as to provide the least amount of invisible work as possible. Without these points a system is likely to impede the user from doing what they want without directly meaning to. 

The usage of ethnography in information technology can be used for more than just identifying the points of what you’re trying to achieve in a system. As explained by Paul Dourish in his writing Implications for Design, sometimes the best thing to come out of an ethnographic study is what no to do. He stresses that too commonly ethnography is purely methodological, as seen in the development of Human Computer Interfaces (HCIs). Whereas Dourish argues that it should be recognized as its own field, its own study. Bringing forth the importance of studying and knowing who you’re creating a product for rather than just focusing on the guidelines that are put in place.
