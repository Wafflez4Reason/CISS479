**Week 8 Reflection**

Social engineering and disinformation are two topics in cyber security that are becoming more and more relevant with each year. There is an entire market out there dedicated to manipulating search engine results. Making it so that you can put your information to the top of whatever search engine you use. These companies are called Search Engine Optimizers (SEOs), and their primary goal is to make use of the data voids that are spread all over the internet to artificially get your post to the top. They use tactics such as using uncommonly searched words like “Oscars” and “crisis actors” to boost your article up in those areas. Now whenever people search up those terms on the internet your result is most likely to be the first one. 

Search engine designers and these SEOs have been in a battle trying to stay ahead each other. Search engineers have a slight advantage in this field, such as Google and Bing. They have kept their search engines proprietary so that way others can’t take advantage of the search engines and rig the system. This manipulation of search engines isn’t done for good usually though. Malicious actors will use these tactics to boost misinformation to the top so that’s what people are likely to see first. Bots and fake accounts are made to try and increase the amount of “real” traffic that these websites and posts get so that way they can boost their search engine scores and appear higher in the queues. Thankfully though, the increased use of machine learning algorithms has helped tremendously when it comes to identifying this information and quarantining it. 

One of the tough aspects when collecting this metadata to feed these machine learning algorithms is trying not to capture information that can be potentially identifying. Companies that have tried to make machine learning algorithms that go through social media are walking a landmine of potentially collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on random people that they don’t mean to. This information should first be anonymized to make sure that it can’t be traced back to the users in the event of a leak. The main goal should be the identification of misinformation, not the gathering too much information about people.
