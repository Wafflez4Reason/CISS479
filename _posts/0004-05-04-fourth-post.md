With the ever-increasing lack of privacy across the internet it is proving more and more difficult with each day to figure out where those boundaries of privacy lie. Your information and data is harvested throughout nearly any activity online and some in person. Websites share tracking information and other data on what you like with ad agencies to promote and come up with targeted advertising for only you. 

The problem with the lack of privacy in our society is becoming a growing concern for most people. With privacy issues and data leaks being pushed by news outlets more often than they’ve ever been, making sure that your information is secure and not traced is becoming nearly impossible. Machine learning algorithms have been in the works for years creating profiles on who you are and what you like. These profiles are then shared and bought between different companies and agencies and that’s how you receive those targeted ads. Even when you try and disguise yourself from these algorithms, they still can trace your location and give you recommendations based on what other people around you like. 

Take for instance the story from Danah Boyd, an ethnographer who was travelling across the US to study teenage groups and culture. She said that one day she found that since she had been travelling across the Midwest for the last month or so that she was “getting fascinating advertisements for grill guards, CB radios, and other accessories for my non-existent big rig.” These machine learning algorithms that try and put a product to who you are thought she was a long-haul trucker from just her location data alone. 

One of the only ways that has been found to try and trick these machine learning algorithms is by using cultural references. These may still be tracked, but they work as a sort of social steganography to hide what you’re truly talking about. In a world where everything is tracked and traced to be used for profit, hiding in plain sight may be one of the only ways to go.
