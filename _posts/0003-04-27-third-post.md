**Week 4 Reflection**

The power and conflicts that come with a globalization of computers around the world is vast and far reaching. Benkler goes into detail about this subject in his paper Degrees of Freedom, Dimensions of Power where he talks about the tussles and conflicts that have risen from the creating of the internet. Something that has grown far bigger than the original creators of the ARPANET project would have ever have guessed. In its creation, the internet was initially a platform to facilitate research projects and communications. It has since then been monetized and had many functions of it bought and controlled. If you take a step back and look at how the internet is owned and run today, you would find very few companies in possession of the majority of the internet. With their grasp tight and controlling, but still giving the potential illusion of freedom to the user. Such as the case with Apple and the apps that they allow on their phones. Over the years, they have become more and more restrictive, completely banning the usage of third party apps on their devices any way that they can and removing apps from the store for strictly political reasons.

Even though the internet is mainly controlled by the giants of the world, David Clark brings forward quite a few interesting points on how the internet is used. He brings forward the idea of how since there was no idea in mind when originally designing the internet, that it has instead been turned into a sort of general purpose network. This design, or lack thereof, has helped shape the internet into what it is today. Unlike a telephone line which has a specific purpose, the internet can be used for nearly anything. This has handed some control back to the user. He says how the users are the active force in steering the internet and what they want to use it for. That the consumers pocket is the one that chooses how these companies act and what they do. 

The internet isn’t without it’s tussles though. A tussle could be described as a conflict between two parties. As examined by our professor Dustin O’Hara, these tussles help shape the functionality of the internet as it provides a source of communication for these, a medium for them to be examined, studied, and worked out.
