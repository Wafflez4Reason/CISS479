Abstract
One of the appeals of using cryptocurrencies over regular money is the fact that most people believe it is completely anonymous. It is thought that this form of money is untraceable, that it can be used for any sort of transaction without the threat of being found or having it traced back to you. This idea has led to the currency being used for malicious activities such as money laundering, payment of drugs, guns, and illegal videos. With a large web of criminal activity being siphoned into using cryptocurrency as a form of staying under the radar and away from the authorities it’s believed that they provide a layer of anonymity for the buyer and seller. It is thought to be non-identifiable, untraceable, and leaves them unreachable from the authorities. But are these cryptocurrencies really as anonymous as people claim? What are the different types of coins that truly provide this level of anonymity that people are looking for? Lastly, what are countries doing to combat the malicious usage of them?

1.	Introduction
“Cryptocurrency” is a term that has been coined for any form of decentralized currency that is hosted purely online. There is no physical form of the currency, no tangible way to hold it or see what it is. It exists entirely through the transactions of blockchain ciphers that machines encrypt and decrypt. Somehow this currency has become more and more relevant over the years, having developed all sorts of different applications over time. Although made with good intentions, these coins quickly became the main vector for malicious activities. Often times they’re the currency of choice for ransoms, smuggling, money laundering, buying guns, and more. They leave a very dark and mysterious trail behind them wherever they are found. 

2.	What is Cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency has four main defining principles. In order to qualify as a cryptocurrency, it must be decentralized, provide strong security behind transactions, have a digital ledger of transactions, and work in a shroud of secrecy. Without these four pillars, it would not be considered a cryptocurrency at all. 

2.1	The Pillars of Crypto
Breaking each one of these requirements down shows how the fundamentals of these currencies work and why they’re able to hold value. Starting off with the decentralization of cryptocurrencies we can see that the true value lies behind trust, privacy, and security in its value. It’s more common to form a centralized currency that will fall with whatever entity created it. The decentralized currency has no entity binding it to one group or government. Along with this, having a decentralized currency such as a cryptocurrency gives many other advantages. This model allows any user to act as a payment processor lending their hardware to the encryption and decryption process of these coins thus allowing users to aid in the process of their chosen coins. It also makes it so that information can’t be directly seized by authority figures, so a government can’t come and take control of all of your funds. Along with this, you can instantly access these funds anywhere in the world and transfer them into whatever currency you need with no penalties. But the main appeal is veil of privacy and anonymity that comes with using these coins rather than a centralized currency. There is no common method of tracing who the buyer and seller are in these transactions, although it is still possible for some groups to break through this veil. 

Focusing from the main benefits of decentralization to the strong cryptography behind these coins, we can see the process that goes behind securing each transaction that occurs. There is a complex set of actions that happen each time a transaction a made. The first step in creating one of these transactions is for the buyer to send a transaction request to the servers hosting their coin. From there, the request is then broadcasted to a peer-to-peer network that consists of nodes that are set up to then start the encryption process. The network of nodes then uses known algorithms to validate transactions and user status, verify the transaction, then add it to a block with other transactions. This block is then encrypted again, verified, and then recorded into the ledger. The new block is then added to existing blockchain where it will be permanent and unalterable. Finally, the transaction is finished. 

The aforementioned ledger keeps track of all information that occurs in a given coin’s transactions. It records all transactions and is publicly viewable. This ledger cannot be altered or tampered with, so it acts as a permanent record for everything that happens within a given blockchain. The reasoning behind this is quite simple; it creates trust. You can see what happens. You can see who requested what, and who the coins move between. Now for most people this isn’t viewable at all and their main identities are still hidden but keep this in mind for later on. This paper trail provides a layer of stability for the coin. It proves each transaction and prevents duplication from happening as well. 
This all gives way to the layer of secrecy and anonymity that so many desire from cryptocurrencies. The shroud of secrecy that it creates is enough for most, but it doesn’t mean that the user is completely hidden from prying eyes. 

3.	Brief History of Crypto
Before moving further along with the security and privacy that different types of coins may provide, we must first look at why these coins were created in the first place. The 2008 recession took a toll on many peoples’ lives and impacted their trust. Big banks and government had failed the people which left them to pick up the slack of what was left. This distrust in the government and big banks was the first spark that started the movement of cryptocurrency. Having a decentralized currency would mean that there wasn’t the risk of it all going down in one fell swoop. This would lead towards the creation of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and more. 

Along with this distrust in centralized powers, having a currency that wasn’t at risk of immediate seizure by one entity was a big bonus. This disconnect from any central power allowed these groups to use this cryptocurrency in the same way Swiss banks are used: to store money in off shore accounts that are untouchable by any form of government. With them being decentralized in nature, it also allowed for them to be withdrawn almost immediately from anywhere in the world giving groups nearly instantaneous access to these funds regardless of location. 

4.	Trust in Crypto
There is an inherent trust that must lie within these coins for them to contain any value at all. Without trust, these coins are valueless. Trust provides a way to prove authenticity of a party using the coin. It makes the user base greater and allows for the growth of the coin. Throughout cryptocurrencies there are many different levels of trust that must first be established for any transaction to be successful. 

4.1	Layers of Trust
Layers of trust cover many different sections of the transaction of a coin. They can be found first in the blockchain being used, followed by the collective governance process of the coin, the wallets and platforms the coin is traded on, and finally the initial coin offerings that are proposed. 

Without first establishing trust in the blockchain being used, you have nothing. The blockchain along with the algorithm that governs it is the driving force behind the security of a coin and the privacy of the user. 

Once you’ve achieved this step, you must then establish trust in the collective governance process of a coin. This process can either build trust in the community (thus build value in the coin), or it can split the community and break trust. This process of splitting in the community is known as a hard fork. When a hard fork happens, it will split the blockchain of the coin and create a new blockchain based off of it. This can be seen with the Bitcoin hard fork of August 2017. Bitcoin split and became both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash which eroded some of the value of Bitcoin and divided its community base. 

After you have moved past this step of trust, you then have to make sure that you are using a platform that can be trusted. It is especially hard to create trust in these factors since they have basically become a centralized hub for exchanging these coins. Unlike banks and other common centralized powers, these platforms have no rules, no regulations, and nothing holding them accountable to their actions. This lack of accountability is what gives way to so many scams occurring at this point in the trust chain. For example, as of late 2017, Reuters published that an estimated 980,000 various coins worth up to $15 billion had been stolen over the prior six years. 

Even after establishing trust through all of these layers, you may still be at risk though. Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are much like IPOs in the stock market. They are a value that is given to a coin before it becomes pubic for people to invest and buy into. Before buying into one of these ICOs, you must first make sure that there aren’t any backdoor deals that have been struck prior to its release either propping up the value beforehand or purposely undervaluing it. 

4.2	Anonymity in Crypto
Coins work off of the assumption that the user is secured and private in the transactions that they make and that their anonymity throughout these transactions is confined only to them. This means that they must be non-identifiable, unreachable, and untraceable throughout the entirety of the transaction. But to many people’s dismay, the usage of a public ledger hinders that layer of anonymity greatly.

Having a coin that is entirely anonymous sounds great to you and me, but the government doesn’t like that idea very much. Coins such as Monero, Dash, Zcash, and Verge all take different approaches in keeping the user completely anonymous and out of the governments eyes. But different governments have been researching ways to bypass these layers of privacy. 

4.3	Japan and Russia
Japan and Russia are taking a much more traditional approach of trying to track cryptocurrency within their countries. They are implementing strict know-your-customer policies. These policies would make sure that any wallet or platform would be following strict guidelines on keeping track of who operates and uses coins. Failure to follow these practices will result in large fines and possibly the banning of your platform. This information is given to their respective data collection agency to then visualize the data and find people who are conducting transactions. 

4.4	The United States
The United States is going for a much different approach in having the NSA create a VPN that essentially tracks all information that goes through it. If you don’t download and use this VPN, they have no real way of tracking the majority of transactions. 

4.5	China and India
China and India are directly receiving all data from exchanges. After collecting this data, they are using it to create visualizations of where the transactions are stemming from and ending. They are taking a similar approach to Japan and Russia by using the information that they have gathered on their own people to draw conclusions as to who is making these transactions.  Much like what Danah Boyd said in her paper Surveillance & Society, “...how machines see us depends on how our data connects to others.” The conclusions that are being drawn from these transactions are invading people’s privacy and making assumptions about them that they themselves are completely unaware of. 

5.	Conclusion
There is a layer of privacy that is stripped away from the user when using many of the common cryptocurrencies nowadays. The government wants to know who is using what, how they’re using it, and when they’re using it. They want to know your every move and keep a close eye on the actions you’re taking. But that doesn’t mean all of the coins leave you out in the open. Coins such as Monero are completely untraceable. They use a combination of ring signatures and stealth addresses to mask their users. It is so powerful, in fact, that it’s being outlawed in some countries because they have no way of tracing it, creating one of the only sources of true anonymity that anyone can have in our modern day society.
