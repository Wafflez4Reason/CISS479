**Week 2 Reflection**

Creating usable security that is actually user friendly seems to be the never-ending chase of cat and mouse. No matter what you do to try and incorporate the perfect model for security, it just realistically isn’t achievable. Kai-Ping Yee defines several different criteria for usable security. He gives different metrics that can be used to measure the effectiveness and, quite frankly, the usability of a system. In order to achieve the perfect system it must have an obvious path of least resistance, have active privilege granting and revoking, be able to view others actions, recognize distinct users, have clear and distinct boundaries, present the consequences of an action, and clearly show decisions and actions.
 
Now if this seems like a laundry list of tasks to try and accomplish to create the perfect system, you would be right. There is a reason why product management frameworks like Agile and others exist to try and help achieve as many of these tasks as possible. There is no way to achieve every point that has been made without sacrificing one or more parts of it. As put by Simpson Garfinkel “If such rules existed, we would almost certainly all be using them, and the usability problem would be solved.” There are reasons that people resort to using sticky notes and other bad practices to keep passwords. It’s systems that try and achieve as much as they can but then lack the ease of use for the user. 
 
Throughout the DesignX reading, it discusses the varies challenges of designing complex and high level programs. There are many different tasks to focus on when you’re just looking at the big picture, the end goal for a project. It can be overwhelming almost to only see that. I know for a fact that’s how it felt for my senior project. Trying to accomplish anything without breaking down the system to its smallest components first and then working up from there proved to be a waste of time. The author explains a development framework that sounds very similar to the standard Software Development Lifecycle that is found in many companies today. Creating a more friendly environment for development to happen, as well as create a system achieving as many of the usable security points as possible.
