**Week 7 Reflection**

The usage of biometrics by UNHCR on refugees is surprising to me to say the least. It never occurred to me that it would be such a prominent way to track or identify people, or that there would even be the need for that in the first place. With the usage of iris recognition on Afghan refugees starting in 2002, the first major example of refugees being manipulated into giving up their privacy for aid can be seen. The UNHCR used the Afghan refugees in Peshawar to essentially test their new technology on. With this, the usage of biometrics to identify refugees has increased more and more. In a sense it makes for a simple way to track and make sure that everyone receives the proper amount of aid that they need. There is no way to forge someone’s eye unlike a signature or just walking up multiple times for aid. 

But much to the excitement of some, this fails to recognize the sacrifice that was made by the refugees to be allowed access to this aid. They either have the choice of keeping their privacy and not being tracked but not receiving aid or give up most every barrier that they have in place to make sure that they can survive. Whereas the people giving out the rations and aid may see a false positive as a glitch in the system and move on, to a refugee this means potentially missing out on life saving supplies. The flaw with using a system such as biometrics is that it’s meant for consistencies to happen for it to work. Without consistencies, it can’t verify what is what. But human nature is just that, not consistent. If someone gets a scratch or anything like that, they won’t be able to use those biometrics until they heal fully. Over the years though this has been remedied by combining a number of biometrics together such as iris scan, fingerprints, and facial recognition. 

Then moving to the topic of racial identification cards, which believe it or not, are a thing. In South Africa there has been the usage of racial identification cards to separate and segregate people based on whatever their card says. This goes as far as to separate kids from their families if they’re marked down as a different race on their card. It’s absolutely atrocious to hear that this type of thing is still accepted in the year that we’re in.
